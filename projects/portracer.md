summary: "Port Tracer is a network security tool designed to identify open ports on a target machine. Using custom-built Python scripts, this tool helps assess potential vulnerabilities in a network by scanning specified IP addresses for open ports. It provides real-time results and enables users to quickly pinpoint weaknesses in a system’s security, making it an essential part of any penetration testing toolkit. The project showcases my ability to work with networking protocols, socket programming, and network security principles."

## How It Works  

Port Tracer operates by scanning a target IP address and checking for open ports within a specified range. It does this using Python’s `socket` library, which enables communication between different devices over a network. The tool follows these steps:  

1. **User Input** – The user specifies the target IP address and the range of ports to scan.  
2. **Connection Attempts** – The script systematically attempts to establish a connection to each port.  
3. **Response Analysis** – If a connection is successful, the port is marked as open; otherwise, it is considered closed or filtered.  
4. **Results Display** – The open ports are displayed in real time, allowing users to analyze potential security risks.  

## Key Features  

- **Custom Python Implementation** – Built entirely in Python without reliance on external frameworks.  
- **Fast and Efficient** – Optimized scanning using multi-threading for quicker results.  
- **Security-Focused** – Helps identify vulnerabilities by detecting open ports that attackers could exploit.  
- **Simple & User-Friendly** – Easy to use, even for those new to network security.  

This project reflects my growing expertise in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and Python programming.
