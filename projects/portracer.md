Port Tracer is a Python-based port scanner designed to identify open ports on a target machine. Using Python’s socket module, it systematically scans a specified IP address and port range, attempting connections to determine which ports are open. Open ports indicate active services, which can be potential security risks if misconfigured. The scanner provides real-time results, displaying detected ports and their common uses (e.g., SSH, HTTP). This project demonstrates my skills in networking, socket programming, and cybersecurity, offering a practical tool for security assessments and penetration testing.

For the Port Tracer project, I developed a Python-based port scanner that scans a specified IP address and port range to identify open ports. I implemented the use of Python’s socket module to attempt connections on each port, marking them as open if the connection is successful. I ensured the tool provides real-time feedback on the open ports and associated services, helping to assess potential security vulnerabilities. This project highlights my ability to write efficient Python scripts for network scanning, handle socket programming, and understand core cybersecurity concepts.
