summary: "Port Tracer is a network security tool designed to identify open ports on a target machine. Using custom-built Python scripts, this tool helps assess potential vulnerabilities in a network by scanning specified IP addresses for open ports. It provides real-time results and enables users to quickly pinpoint weaknesses in a systemâ€™s security, making it an essential part of any penetration testing toolkit. The project showcases my ability to work with networking protocols, socket programming, and network security principles."

Port Tracer is a lightweight yet powerful network security tool designed to help identify open ports on a target machine. It enables users to analyze network security by scanning for potential vulnerabilities.

To give you an idea of how it works, here is an example run:

<hr>

<pre>
Enter the target IP address:
> 192.168.1.1

Enter the range of ports to scan (e.g., 20-1000):
> 20-1000

Scanning in progress...
Port 22 is open (SSH)
Port 80 is open (HTTP)
Port 443 is open (HTTPS)

Scan complete. Total open ports: 3.
</pre>
